# About me

Sup? [Sidon](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ) here! You can also call me Sid.

I'm a HS student and codes sometimes has hobby. (Don't tell others that I like to exploit stuff) 

Friendship over with Windows now Linux is my best friend. 

Distros I'm familiar with:
Ubuntu (too slow),
Kali Linux (unmaintained repositories), 
Arch Linux (how the hell do I use pacman?) and
Debian (Primary distro without any problem)

This person has a lot of trust issues and don't think of pulling him out of depression soon. 

Creating an instagram account was a mistake. I mostly use [my Discord](https://discord.com/users/728604179186188368) for talking with friends. 

I don't like crowds and loud noises and its the reason why I'm hated in the society. 

Just keep it simple and don't use normie emojis while talking with me becuse is get PTSD by them.

Don't ask me about what I did in 2020.

I'm also an amateur hacker (hacked my own dummy discord account and it got banned)
