Sup? [Sidon](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ) here! You can also call me Sid or Haru. 

I'm a student in HS and codes sometimes has hobby. (Don't tell others that I like to exploit stuff) 

Friendship over with Windows not Linux is my best friend. 

This person has a lot of trust issues and don't think of pulling him out of depression soon. 

Creating an instagram account was a mistake. I mostly use [my Discord](https://discord.com/users/728604179186188368) for talking with friends. 

I don't like crouds and loud noises and its the reason why I'm hated in the society. 

Just keep it simple and don't use normie emojis while talking with me becuse is get PTSD by them.

Don't ask me about what I did in 2020.
